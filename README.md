Technical test for junior applications

## Guidelines

- Fork this repository.
- You can add any framework, library or plugin you'd like.
- Make sure the application works out-of-the box once you're done.
- Push changes to your git fork.
- Add a short description on how to run your program for anyone who would like to test it.

- Quality over quantity, better half of the features 100% done, than 100% of the features half-done.

## Assignment :

- You are asked to build a call center application
- As a user I want to see a list of all my clients. I should be able to click on them in order to acess to their show page, where I can find their phone number to call them and to edit them if I call them. The edit page is a form where I can fill all the blank attributes. After the editing is done, the client must have a status "done". Then I can work on my other clients.
- You need to add in the database the clients given in the file clients_sc.json and use it for your user journey
